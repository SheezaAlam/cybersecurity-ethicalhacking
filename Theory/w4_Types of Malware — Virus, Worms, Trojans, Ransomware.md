**Needs user action?** ❌ No

**Prevention:**

* **Patch systems** regularly
* **Segment networks**
* **Use IDS/IPS** (Intrusion Detection/Prevention System)
* Disable unused **ports**

**Example:**
 *Zeus Trojan (2007–2013)* – stole banking credentials through phishing and keylogging.

**Needs user action?** ✅ Yes

**Prevention:**

* Install only from **trusted sources**
* Use **EDR (Endpoint Detection & Response)**
* Train users on **phishing awareness**
* Enable **Application Whitelisting**
* Use a **Firewall**

##  **4. Ransomware**

**Definition:**
Encrypts files and demands money to unlock them.

**Example:**
 *Colonial Pipeline Attack (2021)* – used DarkSide ransomware; disrupted U.S. fuel supply, ransom $4.4M.

**Prevention:**

* **Regular backups** (offline + cloud)
* **Patch systems**
* **Email filters** for phishing
* **Network segmentation**
* Have an **Incident Response Plan**

##  **Quick Comparison Table**

| Type           | Spreads Automatically | Needs User Action | Main Goal / Effect                     |
| -------------- | --------------------- | ----------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Virus**      | ❌ No                  | ✅ Yes             | Corrupt files, spread via user actions |
| **Worm**       | ✅ Yes                 | ❌ No              | Spread fast in networks                |

##  **Example Combined Attack**

> A phishing email installs a **Trojan**, which then downloads **Ransomware** that spreads like a **Worm**, encrypting all systems.

---

##  **Detection & Response**

1. **Detection:** Antivirus, EDR monitoring
2. **Containment:** Disconnect infected systems
3. **Eradication:** Remove malware or restore clean backups
4. **Recovery:** Restore files, reset passwords
5. **Review:** Analyze how it entered and educate users

---

##  **Key Takeaways**

* Always **update** your OS and apps
* Don’t trust unknown links or downloads
* **Backups** are life-savers against ransomware
* Human **awareness** is the strongest antivirus
