# Cybersecurity – Introduction

## What is Cybersecurity?

Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting **digital assets** from threats, attacks, and unauthorized access.
It is a **branch of Information Security** that focuses specifically on safeguarding systems, networks, and data in the digital domain.

## The CIA Triad

The foundation of cybersecurity is built on the **CIA Triad**, which represents three core principles:

1. **Confidentiality**

   * Ensures that information is only accessible to authorized individuals.
   * Prevents unauthorized access to sensitive data.

2. **Integrity**

   * Protects data from unauthorized modification.
   * Ensures that information remains accurate and trustworthy.

3. **Availability**

   * Ensures that systems, applications, and data are accessible whenever needed.
   * Assets must be available 24/7 to authorized users.

## Types of Threats

### Passive Threats

* Involves **monitoring or eavesdropping** without altering data.
* Primarily targets **confidentiality**.
* Example: Packet sniffing.

### Active Threats

* Involves **modification, alteration, or destruction** of data.
* Targets **integrity**.
* Example: Data tampering.

## Common Cybersecurity Threats

1. **Malware**

   * **Virus** – Attaches to files and spreads when executed.
   * **Worm** – Self-replicating, spreads through networks.
   * **Trojan** – Disguised as legitimate software but malicious.
   * **Spyware** – Secretly collects user information.

2. **Ransomware**

   * Encrypts data and demands payment for decryption.

3. **DoS/DDoS Attacks**

   * **Denial of Service (DoS):** Single attacker overwhelms a target system.
   * **Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS):** Multiple attackers flood a target with traffic, causing slowdown or shutdown.

4. **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)**

   * Attacker intercepts communication between two parties.
   * Data can be monitored but not always modified.

## Maintaining the CIA Triad

* **Confidentiality** → Achieved through **encryption**.
* **Integrity** → Achieved through **hashing and digital signatures**.
* **Availability** → Ensured by keeping systems operational and redundant.

## Security Governance

* **Policies**: High-level security rules created by companies to define goals and responsibilities.
* **Procedures**: Step-by-step instructions created to implement policies.
* **Protocols**: Defined standards for secure communication (e.g., HTTPS, SSL/TLS, SSH), considering effectiveness and cost.
