Open Burp → Proxy → Options — ensure a listener exists on 127.0.0.1:8080 and is Running.

In Firefox → Preferences → Network Settings → Manual proxy configuration:

HTTP Proxy: 127.0.0.1 Port: 8080

Check Use this proxy for all protocols

Click OK.

In Burp: Proxy → Intercept — toggle Off to browse normally, On to hold requests.

In Firefox visit: http://burpsuite → Download cacert.der → Preferences → Privacy & Security → View Certificates → Authorities → Import → trust it.

Test browsing: visit http://example.com and then https://example.com. Requests should appear in Burp → Proxy → HTTP history.

Minimal troubleshooting notes:

If ss -lntp | grep 8080 prints nothing: add listener in Burp Proxy → Options.

If pages hang, turn Intercept Off.

If HTTPS shows cert errors after import, restart Firefox.
