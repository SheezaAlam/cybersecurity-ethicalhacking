## Phases Completed (Overview)

Today’s lab covered the initial phases of an authorized penetration test in a controlled environment. The phases completed are:

* Reconnaissance
* Information gathering
* Scanning and enumeration
* Initial access (proof-of-concept, non-destructive)

Detailed write-ups, sanitized outputs, screenshots, and subsequent phases (exploitation lab practice, persistence, and post-exploit analysis) will be shared later — only for systems where explicit permission is documented and all artifacts are redacted as needed.
