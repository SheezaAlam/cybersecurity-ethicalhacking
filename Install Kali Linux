# Install Kali Linux on VMware (Step-by-Step)

This guide documents how I installed Kali Linux on VMware Workstation Player (Windows 10/11). It uses the official **Installer 64-bit ISO**, not a prebuilt VM image.

## Prerequisites

* A 64-bit CPU with virtualization support (**Intel VT-x** or **AMD-V**)
* At least **2 CPU cores**, **4 GB RAM** (6–8 GB recommended), and **40 GB** free disk space
* Windows 10/11 with admin rights

### Enable virtualization in BIOS/UEFI

1. Reboot your PC, enter BIOS/UEFI setup.
2. Enable **Intel VT-x** or **AMD-V** (sometimes called **SVM**), save and exit.
3. In Windows, open **Task Manager → Performance → CPU** and confirm **Virtualization: Enabled**.

### Avoid Hyper-V conflicts (if VMware complains)

Open **Windows Terminal (Admin)** and run:

```powershell
bcdedit /set hypervisorlaunchtype off
```

Restart Windows. If needed, also turn off these in **Windows Features**:

* Hyper-V
* Windows Hypervisor Platform
* Virtual Machine Platform

Disable **Memory Integrity**: Windows Security → Device Security → Core isolation.

## Downloads

1. **Kali Linux (Installer ISO, 64-bit)**
   From the official Kali website → **Get Kali → Installer Images**.
   File name looks like: `kali-linux-20xx.x-installer-amd64.iso`.

2. **VMware Workstation Player (Windows)**
   From VMware’s official site. Install with defaults.

### (Optional) Verify ISO checksum

In PowerShell, run inside the folder where the ISO is saved:

```powershell
Get-FileHash .\kali-linux-*-installer-amd64.iso -Algorithm SHA256
```

Compare the output with the SHA256 hash on Kali’s download page.

## Create the VM in VMware

1. Open **VMware Workstation Player** → **Create a New Virtual Machine**.
2. Choose **Installer disc image file (iso)** and browse to the Kali ISO.
3. Guest OS:

   * **Linux**
   * **Debian 12.x 64-bit** (or Debian 11 64-bit if 12 isn’t listed)
4. Name: `Kali Linux` and choose a VM location.
5. Processors: **2** cores (use more if available).
6. Memory: **4096 MB** minimum (6144–8192 MB recommended).
7. Network: **NAT** (safer for beginners; can change later).
8. Disk: **40 GB** (or more) → **Store as a single file**.
9. Customize Hardware:

   * **Display**: check **Accelerate 3D graphics**
   * **Options → Guest Isolation**: enable **Copy and paste** and **Drag and drop**
10. Finish.

## Install Kali (inside the VM)

1. Power on the VM → choose **Graphical install**.
2. Select language, location, keyboard.
3. Hostname: `kali` (or any). Leave **Domain name** blank unless joining an org domain.
4. Create a normal user and set a strong password.
5. Time zone: select your region/city. If you only see U.S. zones, fix later with `tzdata` (see Troubleshooting).
6. Partitioning: **Guided – use entire disk** → **All files in one partition** → **Finish** → **Write changes to disk = Yes**.
7. Network mirror: **Yes** (recommended).
8. Install **GRUB** to the primary disk (e.g., `/dev/sda`) → **Yes**.
9. Reboot when installation completes.

## First boot setup

Log in with the user you created, then open Terminal:

### Update and upgrade

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt full-upgrade -y
```

### VMware guest tools (clipboard, auto-resize)

```bash
sudo apt install -y open-vm-tools open-vm-tools-desktop
sudo reboot
```

## If you boot to a text console (no desktop)

If you see a login like `kali tty1` instead of a graphical login, install and enable XFCE + LightDM:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y kali-desktop-xfce lightdm
sudo systemctl enable lightdm --now
```

If prompted to choose a display manager, select **lightdm**. Reboot if the GUI doesn’t appear immediately:

```bash
sudo reboot
```

## Optional tuning

### Set correct time zone (if wrong during install)

```bash
sudo dpkg-reconfigure tzdata
```

Choose your **Region → City** (for example, `Asia → Karachi`).

### Take a clean snapshot (recommended)

In VMware Player: **Player → Manage → Snapshot**. This lets you roll back easily later.

### Install additional tool groups when needed

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install kali-tools-wireless
sudo apt install kali-tools-web
```

## Quick troubleshooting

* **VMX/AMD-V disabled or 64-bit guests unavailable**
  Enable virtualization in BIOS/UEFI (see Prerequisites).

* **Black screen or stuck at console**
  Ensure LightDM is installed and running:

  ```bash
  sudo systemctl status lightdm
  sudo systemctl start lightdm
  sudo systemctl enable lightdm
  ```

* **No internet in VM**
  In VMware, check **Player → Removable Devices → Network Adapter** is **Connected** (NAT). In Kali:

  ```bash
  sudo dhclient -v
  ```

* **VMware vs Hyper-V conflict**
  Disable Hyper-V as shown above and reboot.

## Notes

* This guide uses the **Installer ISO**, not prebuilt images, so you control partitioning, users, and configuration.
* NAT networking is recommended for safety. Switch to Bridged only if you know why you need it.
